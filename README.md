# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to retrieve the titles of all employees at Pewlett Hackard expected to retire in the near future. Those qualified for retirement at this time must have been born between the years of 1952 and 1955. The data originally showed duplicate entries because some/many of these employees may have held various titles throughout their career at Pewlett Hackard. To remove duplicate entires, the data was further filtered to show the latest/most recent title held by these retiring employees.

Additionally, employees eligible for participating in the mentorship program were identified.
